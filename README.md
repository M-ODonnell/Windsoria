Windsoria / Windstoria is an evening of ‘imaginary mapping’ and narratives concerned with place, with history, and with Windsor, Ontario.  

With performances by local story-tellers of every sort, and the launch of a website devoted to the interactive mapping of Windsoria — a city of desire, of openness, of culture, that mis-recognises borders, that interrogates present and future conceptions of this region, including Detroit — this event promises to introduce counter-mapping, cognitive mapping, and local histories and stories with performances live and online at the city’s only artist-run centre, Artcite Incorporated.
